Prompt to use:

Please complete code for the below project requirements: 1. create a django project name similarity_search, 2. create django app similarity_search_app with following functionalities i) home page for similarity search with source type as dropdown(ADMIN. IT, FINANCE, HR) control, Search Keyword as Textbox, Search button, ii) in home page, implement the similarity search using sqlite_vec(sqlite vector extension), based chosen source type, keyword text entered for similarity search, iii) sign up page with email address as username, iv) sign in page with email address as username, v) sign out functionality,  vi) on click of "Search" button, perform the similarity search and return top 25 match results with distance in the table format with pagination functionality and page size as 5 records/results. vii) in the home page, similarity search should be allowed after user successful login. viii) do not use typescript. any javascript libraries like angular, react or any other libraries, only use bootstrap controls and forms. ix) create separate sqlite database for search source type(each one for ADMIN. IT, FINANCE, HR [separate databases]) x) each database should contain source table named "source_tbl" with columns like id, source_text and other source related metadata columns; embedding table named embedding_tbl with id, embedding_vect(float data type to store 768 dimensional embeddings generated by st5 transformer model) and metadata column to source table record as json string. xi) similarity search should be performed on the embedding_vect table. xii) All the pages should follow the common page header with logo text and navigation links as navbar and common page footer. xiii) do not use typescript. any javascript libraries like angular, react or any other libraries, only use bootstrap controls and forms. xiv) provide the step by step instructions to integrate these project files in README.md file.
